Any picture (jpg, png, bmp, etc) will automatically be displayed from any folder here.

The slides are sorted alphabetically/numerically(1 comes before 2, a comes before b, 1 comes before a, and so on).
Any folder sorted in a folder starting with A or 1 will contain the first slides. 
(For an example using theoretical folder and picture names, elephant.jpg is stored in the artwork folder, 
 elephant.jpg will be displayed before apple.jpg stored in the canvas folder.)
